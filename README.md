### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm usually just on GitLab, nothing here is going to be up to date. 

I'm generally a C/C++ developer for embedded systems, but I do have a soft spot for big, super parallelized stuff. Bonus points if it's super parallelizable stuff that can run on super lightweight hardware/embedded systems. 

I'm currently just on github for my dumb twitch bot, ChatRat. But I might end up putting up some simple arduino stuff that I mess around with on my free time, as well as other things. Maybe even some hardware work, I've been meaning to get some effort back into kicad because I do love making little hardware projects. 

If you wanna reach out about anything in any of the repos I maintain, or want me to look at something you think would be cool, shoot me an email. I sometimes respond to those.
